# Express project starter

This is a starter project for Express. It was created with the express project generator and then modified to be a module type (uses imports instead of requires, based on [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-enable-es6-and-beyond-syntax-with-node-and-express-68d3e11fe1ab/)), and with VSCode launch settings.
